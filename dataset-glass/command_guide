./darknet detector train /home/user/folder_project/file.data /home/user/folder_project/yolov7.cfg /home/user/folder_project/yolov7.weights

If you want to train from the beginning, then use flag in the end of training command: -clear 

To know the accuracy, use:

./darknet detector map /home/user/folder_project/file.data /home/user/folder_project/yolov7.cfg /home/user/folder_project/backup-weights/yolov7_last.weights

To perform the inference, use:

python3 darknet_images.py\ 
--weights ./home/user/folder_project/backup-weights/yolov7_last.weights\
--data_file ./home/user/folder_project/file.data\
--config_file ./home/user/folder_project/yolov7.cfg\
--tresh 0.5\
--input ./home/user/folder_project/folder_train/image.jpg\
--ext_output

You can find this code within the Darknet project as well.
