[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/934472178.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14910653)

This dataset was used to train a YOLOv7 network for glass facade detection, containing 70 images for training and 36 images for testing. The objective of the project was to integrate a RealSense camera for real-time detection. The network training was successfully conducted.

[To use this dataset with YOLOv7 and Darknet, as done in this project, it is necessary to access the Darknet configuration files on the page: ](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)
