[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/934472178.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14910653)

This dataset was used to train a YOLOv7 network for glass facade detection, containing 70 images for training and 36 images for testing. The objective of the project was to integrate a RealSense camera for real-time detection. The network training was successfully conducted.

To use this dataset with YOLOv7 and Darknet, as done in this project, it is necessary to access the Darknet configuration files on the page: [Darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)

Within the [command_guide](https://github.com/monymon/dataset-facadeglass-yolov7/blob/main/dataset-glass/command_guide) file, you will find instructions on how to perform the training, evaluate accuracy, and check the inference.
